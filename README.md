## GeoCoder

This module uses Google Maps Geocoding API to parse input address into a correct format and find corresponding Lat/Lng coordinates.

There are several notebooks available there:
  1. One uses as a dataset Historical-Settlement-Reports XLSX file for the first half of 2017 from DATA.GOV.AU.
  2. Another one uses archived Historical-Settlement-Reports dataset from 2016 from DATA.GOV.AU. The only difference from the first notebook is the capability to open ZIP archive and extract an appropriate file from there.
  3. csv2geojson converter. This notebook is helpful to convert CSV files, generated at previous steps, into GeoJSON files which can be used by various visualisation libraries, e.g. ipyleaflet, folium, etc.

The notebook is also available there: https://anaconda.org/alexf/geocoder/notebook
