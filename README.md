## GeoCoder

This module uses Google Maps Geocoding API to parse input address into a correct format and find corresponding Lat/Lng coordinates.

There are a few version of the notebooks there:
  * One uses as a dataset Historical-Settlement-Reports XLSX file for the first half of 2017 from DATA.GOV.AU.
  * Another one uses archived Historical-Settlement-Reports dataset from 2016 from DATA.GOV.AU. The only difference from the first notebook is the capability to open ZIP archive and extract an appropriate file from there.

The notebook is also available there: https://anaconda.org/alexf/geocoder/notebook
